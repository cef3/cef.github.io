I'm a Theatre major from Pittsfield, MA. I am pursuing an Honors Project in Theatre this year responding to Medea and an anime called Elfen Lied!

### my elevator pitch

In this class, I hope to connect my creative spark with these two skills to expand which mediums I feel comfortable creating in. As an actor, I am constantly searching for ways to expand my creative potential so I can be prepared to offer everything I can to a group of artists instead of solely focusing on one medium of expression. I'm confident that this class will push my creative boundaries while giving me some very solid life skills!
