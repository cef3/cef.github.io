Assignment Description: I prototyped a circuit with three LED lights, a battery and battery holder, a switch, and a button, and sewed them to a piece of felt with conductive thread.
Then, I cut out the felt in the "plushie" shape, whip stiched, and stuffed it, and created a light-up plushie!The plushie lights up when the switch is on and the button is pressed.

A tip or trick-- model the plushie prototype __exactly__ how you'd model a plain old circuit for the worksheet, and don't let the orientation of the LEDs on the plushie confuse you!
