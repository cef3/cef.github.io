__Plushy Redux__


Assignment Description: For the Plushy Redux assignment, I represented the plushy LED circuitry with code. Using values to represent the button and switch being on, the code then checks the values of each LED and prints "On" or "Off" for each light.

A tip or trick-- Think through the logic of the statements to guide indentation.

__Odd Menu__

Assignment Description: Using code, a user can input an order number and a meal option and recieve one of six meals-- three from a secret menu, and three from a regular menu.

A tip or trick-- Run small pieces of code first!! Once one part works, other chunks are sometimes nearly identical!
