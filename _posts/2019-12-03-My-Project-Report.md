Revised Paper Prototyped:

3 Tips to Past Self:
Make detailed descriptions of what each draft of code does to come back to it later!
Make sure that deadlines are set in advance so that sewing isn’t done at the last minute.
Use all ability to streamline circuitry!!

I don’t have photos of different stages of the project, but I’ve submitted three different “pieces” or “steps” of my code that I used as building blocks along the way.
