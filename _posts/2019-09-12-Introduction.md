My name is Caroline Fairweather, I use she/her pronouns, and I am a Theatre Major and a Leadership Studies Contentrator in the class of 2020!

I have little sewing experience. I've done minimal sewing for an introductry theatre tech class, so I'm familiar with some basic patterns and am very good at general handywork.
I have absolutely no programming experience! I'm currently working at the Lenox Visitors Center and am in charge of website updates, all of which use Wordpress, so I don't actually work with raw code.
In this class, I hope to connect my creative spark with these two skills to expand which mediums iI feel comfortable creating in. Also, as a young person who will work in this world, I should just probably know how websites work at some point.
