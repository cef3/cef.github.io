My name is Caroline Fairweather, I use she/her pronouns, and I am a Theatre Major and a Leadership Studies Contentrator in the class of 2020!

**Experience & Why Etextiles**

I've done minimal sewing for an introductry theatre tech class, so I'm familiar with some basic patterns and am very good at general handywork.
I have absolutely no programming experience! I'm currently working at the Lenox Visitors Center and am in charge of website updates, all of which use Wordpress, so I don't actually work with raw code.

In this class, i hope to expand my sewing skills beyond what I an incorrectly try to replicate from youtube. Also, as a young person who will work in this world, I should probably know how websites work at some point. Then I can make my own website, an important thing for an actor or theatre artist!

**A Boring Fact**

I use Dove body wash.
