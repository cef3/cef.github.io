__Homemade Switches__


For this assignemnt, I created a simple circuit on my sewing sampler. The circuit lights up one red LED for the dot in the "i" in Williams.
My homemade switches are two patches of conductive thread that are "on" when pinched together, and a "button" made up of three layers: two patches of conductive thread, a layer of felt, and a square of conductive fabric that connects the two thread patches.

A tip or trick-- Think through the logic of the statements to guide indentation.
